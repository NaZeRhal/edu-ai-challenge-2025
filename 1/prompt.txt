I'm selecting the database for a new application. I have the following requirements:
1. Social platform with millions of users
2. Need to store profiles, posts, and connections between users
3. High data read speed required
4. Expected 80% read operations, 20% write operations
5. Scalability is important as the user base grows
Using Chain-of-Thought reasoning analyze a given set of project requirements. Justify and select the most suitable type of database for the project.
