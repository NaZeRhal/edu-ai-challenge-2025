   - Test interactions between players

4. **Add Tests for Game State Transitions**
   - Test transitions between different game states

5. **Add Tests for CPU Player Strategy**
   - Test strategies used by CPU players

## 🎯 Recommendations

### 🔴 High Priority
1. Add test for the uncovered line in Board.js
2. Add test for the uncovered branch in Board.js
3. Add integration tests for player interactions
4. Add tests for game state transitions
5. Add tests for CPU player strategy

### 🟡 Medium Priority
1. Increase test coverage for `markMiss` function
2. Add more edge cases for position validation
3. Add performance tests for large board sizes
4. Add stress tests for rapid game state changes

### 🟢 Low Priority
1. Add documentation tests for constants
2. Add performance tests for frequently called functions
3. Add visual regression tests
4. Add accessibility tests

## 📋 Conclusion
The test suite provides robust coverage of the game's core functionality. All critical paths are tested, and the code demonstrates strong reliability. The addition of adjacency rule testing, CPU strategy validation, and input validation ensures proper game mechanics and fair play. Remaining gaps in function coverage for `HumanPlayer.js` and `Player.js` can be addressed with further targeted tests.
