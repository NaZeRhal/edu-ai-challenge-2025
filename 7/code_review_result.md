# Sea Battle Code Review Results

## 1. Functionality Review Results

### 1.1 Core Game Mechanics
✅ **Ship Placement Logic**
- Random placement works correctly in both HumanPlayer and CPUPlayer
- Ship overlap prevention is implemented through `isValidPosition` checks
- Ships stay within board boundaries due to proper boundary checks
- Ship lengths are consistent and controlled by `SHIP_LENGTH` constant

✅ **Hit/Miss Detection**
- Hit detection is accurate through the `receiveGuess` method
- Miss detection is properly implemented
- Ship sinking detection works through the `isSunk` method
- Win conditions are properly checked in the game loop

✅ **Turn Management**
- Player turns alternate correctly in the `playTurn` method
- CPU turns execute properly with strategy updates
- Game state updates correctly after each turn
- Game termination conditions are properly handled

### 1.2 User Interface
✅ **Board Display**
- Board formatting is clear and consistent
- Symbol representation is standardized
- Coordinate system is intuitive (0-9 grid)
- Visual clarity is maintained with proper spacing

✅ **User Input Handling**
- Input validation is implemented in `isValidGuess`
- Error messages are clear and helpful
- User feedback is provided for all actions
- Input format is consistent (two digits)
