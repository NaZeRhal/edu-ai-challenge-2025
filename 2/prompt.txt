I found a bug. "Logout button doesn’t work on Safari. It just doesn’t respond." I need to create a clear, well-structured bug ticket. The output should follow this format:
Title
Description
Steps to Reproduce
Expected vs Actual Behavior
Environment (if known)
Severity or Impact

I need the output in markdown format. Can you create a file result.md and put the response there?
