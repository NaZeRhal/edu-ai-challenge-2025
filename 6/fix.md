# Enigma Machine Implementation Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the fixes and improvements made to the Enigma machine implementation, focusing on input validation, error handling, and consistent behavior between encryption and decryption operations.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Input Validation Improvements

- **Format Validation**

  - Added strict format validation for rotor positions and ring settings using regex pattern `^\d+\s+\d+\s+\d+$`
  - Added strict format validation for plugboard pairs using regex pattern `^([A-Z]{2}\s*)+$`
  - Improved error messages to clearly specify required formats with examples

- **Range Validation**

  - Enhanced validation for rotor positions and ring settings to ensure values are between 0 and 25
  - Added clear error messages indicating the valid range

- **Plugboard Validation**
  - Improved duplicate letter detection with specific error messages
  - Enhanced self-reference detection with clearer error messages
  - Added format validation with example-based error messages

### 2. Error Handling Enhancements

- **User-Friendly Messages**

  - Added example-based error messages for format validation
  - Improved clarity of range validation messages
  - Enhanced plugboard validation messages with specific examples

- **Consistent Validation**
  - Ensured validation occurs before Enigma instance creation
  - Made validation behavior consistent between encryption and decryption
  - Added validation for all inputs before processing

### 3. Code Structure Improvements

- **Validation Functions**

  - Refactored validation functions for better reusability
  - Added clear separation between format and range validation
  - Improved error message generation

- **Input Processing**
  - Enhanced input parsing with better error handling
  - Added format validation before value validation
  - Improved empty input handling

## Testing

- Added comprehensive test cases for all validation scenarios
- Verified consistent behavior between encryption and decryption
- Confirmed all error messages are clear and helpful
- Validated format requirements are properly enforced

## Future Improvements

- Consider adding more edge cases for format validation
- Monitor user feedback on error messages
- Consider adding integration tests for the CLI
- Explore additional validation scenarios

## Conclusion

The implementation now provides robust input validation with clear, user-friendly error messages. The validation is consistent between encryption and decryption operations, ensuring a reliable user experience. All tests are passing, and the code structure has been improved for better maintainability.
