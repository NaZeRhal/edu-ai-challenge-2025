# Enigma Machine Test Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the test coverage and results for the Enigma machine implementation, including recent improvements in input validation and error handling. All tests were run after the latest code and test updates.

## Test Cases

### 1. Default Settings Encryption/Decryption

- **Purpose:** Ensure that the Enigma machine can correctly encrypt and decrypt a message using default settings.
- **Result:** Passed

### 2. User Settings Encryption/Decryption

- **Purpose:** Verify correct encryption and decryption with custom rotor positions, ring settings, and plugboard pairs.
- **Result:** Passed

### 3. Rotor Stepping

- **Purpose:** Confirm that the rotor stepping and double-stepping mechanisms work as expected.
- **Result:** Passed

### 4. Plugboard Functionality

- **Purpose:** Ensure that plugboard swaps are correctly applied during encryption and decryption.
- **Result:** Passed

### 5. Input Validation Tests

- **Purpose:** Test the robustness of input validation logic for rotor positions, ring settings, and plugboard pairs.
- **Subtests:**
  - Format Validation
    - Rotor positions: Must be exactly three space-separated numbers
    - Ring settings: Must be exactly three space-separated numbers
    - Plugboard pairs: Must be space-separated pairs of letters
  - Empty Input Handling
    - Rotor positions: Shows helpful message with example
    - Ring settings: Shows helpful message with example
    - Plugboard pairs: Returns empty array (valid)
  - Range Validation
    - Rotor positions: Must be between 0 and 25
    - Ring settings: Must be between 0 and 25
  - Plugboard Validation
    - Duplicate letters: Shows which letter is duplicated
    - Self-reference: Shows clear message about self-connection
    - Invalid format: Shows expected format with example

## Test Results Summary

- **All tests passed.**
- The Enigma machine implementation now includes comprehensive input validation and robust error handling.
- Error messages are user-friendly and provide clear guidance on how to fix issues.
- The test suite covers both core functionality and edge cases, ensuring reliability and correctness.
- Validation is consistent between encryption and decryption operations.

## Recommendations

- Continue to maintain and expand test coverage as new features are added.
- Consider adding integration tests for the CLI if further coverage is desired.
