## 1. As an Experienced Developer (Lead/Senior)

- **Goal:** Ensure overall code quality, maintainability, architectural soundness, and adherence to team standards.
- **Main Points to Evaluate/Assess/Check:**
  - **Clarity, Readability, and Simplicity:**
    - _Evaluate_ if the code is easy to understand, logically structured, and avoids unnecessary complexity. Are variable/function names clear and meaningful?
    - _Assess_ if the chosen design patterns are appropriate and consistently applied.
  - **Correctness and Robustness:**
    - _Check_ if the core logic correctly implements the feature requirements and handles expected inputs.
    - _Assess_ the adequacy of error handling, edge case consideration, and resource management (e.g., closing connections, freeing memory if applicable).
  - **Maintainability and Extensibility:**
    - _Evaluate_ if the code is well-organized into modules/classes with clear responsibilities (SRP). Is it DRY?
    - _Assess_ if the changes are easy to modify or extend in the future without major refactoring. Does it introduce undue technical debt?
  - **Testability and Test Coverage:**
    - _Check_ if new functionality is accompanied by comprehensive unit/integration tests.
    - _Assess_ the quality of tests â€“ do they cover happy paths, edge cases, and potential failure modes effectively?
  - **Architectural Alignment & Best Practices:**
    - _Evaluate_ if the solution fits well within the existing system architecture and adheres to established team coding standards, conventions, and best practices.
    - _Check_ for appropriate use of comments (explaining the "why," not just the "what").

## 2. As a Security Engineer

- **Goal:** Identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities and ensure adherence to security best practices.
- **Main Points to Scrutinize/Verify/Assess:**
  - **Input Validation and Output Encoding:**
    - _Scrutinize_ all user-supplied input (including API parameters, form data, file uploads) for proper validation to prevent injection attacks (SQLi, XSS, Command Injection, etc.).
    - _Verify_ that data being displayed or sent to other systems is appropriately encoded to prevent XSS or other interpretation issues.
  - **Authentication and Authorization:**
    - _Assess_ if authentication mechanisms are robust and if authorization checks are correctly implemented to ensure users can only access data/features they are permitted to.
    - _Check_ for insecure direct object references (IDOR) or privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
  - **Data Protection and Privacy:**
    - _Scrutinize_ the handling of sensitive data (PII, credentials, tokens): Is it encrypted at rest and in transit where necessary? Is it logged inappropriately?
    - _Verify_ compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) if applicable.
  - **API Interaction and Dependencies:**
    - _Assess_ the security of interactions with the third-party API (e.g., proper use of API keys/tokens, validation of responses).
    - _Check_ for known vulnerabilities in any new or updated dependencies introduced by the change.
  - **Error Handling and Logging (Security Context):**
    - _Verify_ that error messages do not leak sensitive information (e.g., stack traces, internal system details) to the end-user.
    - _Assess_ if security-relevant events are logged adequately for auditing and incident response.
  - **Secure Configuration:**
    - _Check_ for hardcoded secrets, insecure default configurations, or exposure of sensitive configuration files.

## 3. As a Performance Specialist

- **Goal:** Ensure the code is efficient, scalable, and doesn't introduce performance regressions or bottlenecks.
- **Main Points to Analyze/Evaluate/Check:**
  - **Algorithmic Efficiency and Data Structures:**
    - _Analyze_ the complexity of algorithms used, especially in loops or data processing sections.
    - _Evaluate_ if appropriate data structures are used for the task to optimize lookups, insertions, or traversals.
  - **Resource Utilization (CPU, Memory, I/O):**
    - _Assess_ potential for high CPU usage, excessive memory allocation/garbage collection pressure, or inefficient I/O operations (e.g., reading large files line-by-line when not necessary).
    - _Check_ for resource leaks (e.g., unclosed database connections, file handles).
  - **Database Interactions:**
    - _Analyze_ database queries for efficiency. Are indexes used effectively? Are there N+1 query problems?
    - _Evaluate_ transaction management and potential for deadlocks or long-running transactions.
  - **API Call Patterns and Network Latency:**
    - _Assess_ the frequency and payload size of calls to the third-party API. Can calls be batched? Is data being over-fetched?
    - _Check_ for appropriate timeouts and retry mechanisms for external calls, considering network latency.
  - **Caching Strategies:**
    - _Evaluate_ if caching is used appropriately for frequently accessed, expensive-to-compute data.
    - _Assess_ the cache invalidation strategy to ensure data freshness without unnecessary re-computation.
  - **Concurrency and Scalability:**
    - _Analyze_ any concurrent operations for potential race conditions, deadlocks, or thread starvation.
    - _Evaluate_ how the code might perform under increased load and identify potential scaling bottlenecks.
